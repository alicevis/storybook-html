# storybook-html

This repo tests:
- `@storybook/html` - specifically docs, controls and a11y addons.
- Linking to external static UI resources in `.storybook\preview-head.html`, which are bundled by Parcel by running `npm start` in this [separate repo](https://github.com/basher/parcel-boilerplate-storybook).
